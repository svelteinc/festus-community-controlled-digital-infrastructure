# festus-community-controlled-digital-infrastructure
Public-good playbook for a community-controlled digital infrastructure platform in Festus, MO — governance, capital stack, and engagement model that any city can adapt.
This repository contains a practical, reusable playbook for structuring a community-controlled digital infrastructure project (e.g., data center) in Festus, Missouri.
It includes:

A governance model (FDIA/FCIC) that keeps land and covenants in local hands.
A conservative Phase 1 capital stack that uses private debt/equity while protecting the city’s budget.
Optional Phase 2 tokenization concepts for community bonds.
Public-facing materials (vision, council briefing, Facebook explainer, FAQ) that other communities can adapt.
Code is licensed under MIT, documentation under CC BY 4.0, so any city can clone, adapt, and improve this model.
