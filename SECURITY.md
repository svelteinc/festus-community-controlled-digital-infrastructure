# Security Policy

This repository currently contains planning, documentation, and prototype code for
community-controlled digital infrastructure. It is not a production system, but we
still take security reports seriously.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you believe you have found a security issue in this repository or in code that
could reasonably be derived from it, please do not open a public issue.

Instead, email a report to:

- gf@svelteinc.co

Please include as much detail as you can:

- A description of the issue and where it is located
- Any steps needed to reproduce
- Any potential impact you have identified
- Your contact information so we can follow up

## What to Expect

We aim to acknowledge new reports within a reasonable time frame, but we do not
currently provide a formal service-level agreement.

If the issue is confirmed, we will work to address it in a way that respects both
security and the public-good nature of this project. When appropriate, we may
credit you for responsible disclosure in commit messages or release notes, unless
you prefer to remain anonymous.

Please avoid publicly disclosing details of the vulnerability until we have had a
chance to investigate and, if necessary, release a fix or additional guidance.
