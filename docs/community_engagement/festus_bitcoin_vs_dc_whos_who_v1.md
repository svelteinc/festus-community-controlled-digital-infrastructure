# Who is involved in the bitcoin facility vs. the Festus data center idea

## 1. Bitcoin facility near the Armory (Highway P, Hematite)

- **Project type:** Dedicated bitcoin mining facility.
- **Developers and operators:** NYDIG (bitcoin mining company based in New York) and Global Connect Communications (telecommunications company based in Florida).
- **Government and land:** Jefferson County (permitting authority, including final occupancy permit) and the Missouri National Guard Armory at 2740 Highway P (access easement for the site's main road).
- **Infrastructure and impacts:** Ameren (power and substation), nearby residents on and around Highway P (noise, traffic, transparency, and quality of life).

This project is already physically present near the Armory with 24/7 security and signs that say bitcoin mining.
It has not yet received a final occupancy permit, and the county has said operations cannot fully start until there is a permanent access easement from the armory property.

## 2. Festus 240-acre data center concept (north of 67, west of CC, near I-55)

- **Project type:** General data center campus, not specifically labeled as bitcoin.
- **Developer:** CRG, the data center development arm of Clayco, a St. Louis based design-build and development firm.
- **City and public decision-makers:** Festus City Council (annexation, zoning, and any incentives), City Administrator Greg Camp (process, transparency, and staff recommendations).
- **Tax and service beneficiaries:** The City of Festus, the local school district, Jefferson County, and other tax-funded services, depending on the final structure.
- **Guardrails and process:** Festus has adopted basic data center rules on noise limits, notification to nearby residents, and requirements for community meetings.

This concept is at an earlier, framework stage.
The 240 acres have been annexed into Festus for possible data center development, but specific tenants and project details are still emerging.

## 3. Why this distinction matters

Residents see the physical bitcoin facility near the Armory today, but that site is separate from the Festus data center concept described in this playbook.
The goal of the civic model here is to give Festus and other communities tools to structure any large digital infrastructure project under public-purpose entities, clear financial risk boundaries, and real resident oversight, instead of relying on one-off, opaque deals.

Both sites also sit within a broader small-city corridor that includes Herculaneum, Pevely, Festus, Crystal City, Hematite, De Soto, Olympian Village and nearby towns along I-55 and US-67. A separate corridor strategy note describes how that wider region can pursue advanced manufacturing and carefully governed digital infrastructure instead of one-off, opaque deals.
