# Options for Festus: Data Centers, Connectivity, and Community Control (Draft v1)

> **Purpose.** This one-pager lays out realistic options for Festus. It is not a yes/no on any specific project and not legal, tax, or investment advice.

---

## 1. Option A – Host a hyperscale data center in city limits

**What it is:**

- A very large (50–100 MW+) campus inside Festus.
- Heavy use of power, land, and (depending on design) water.

**Possible upsides:**

- Headline tax numbers (depending on incentives).
- Construction jobs; a limited number of permanent jobs (often dozens, not hundreds).

**Risks/tradeoffs:**

- Strong pressure for large tax abatements (Chapter 100, state incentives).
- Noise, visual impact, and potential light pollution.
- Strain on power and water systems; risk that residential/commercial rates feel the impact.
- Political and legal risk if residents feel the deal was rushed or opaque.

**Fit with community control:**

- Harder to control if the deal is negotiated under time pressure and heavy incentives.
- Requires very strong covenants and oversight to be acceptable.

## 2. Option B – Small, “good neighbor” data centers + regional/utility data center

**What it is:**

- One small, well-regulated modular data center in Festus (e.g., 1–5 MW) under FCIIA + Festus Civic Assembly rules.
- Edge/micro sites in industrial/utility areas only, with tight noise, water, and design standards.
- Larger compute needs served by:
  - Regional data centers in the St. Louis area, and/or
  - A future regional/utility-style data center sited outside the most sensitive areas.

**Possible upsides:**

- Keeps “good neighbor” scale inside Festus.
- Builds local technical capacity and revenue through a pilot project.
- Uses fiber and regional partnerships to access larger compute without siting a hyperscale box in town.

**Risks/tradeoffs:**

- Less headline tax revenue than a hyperscale campus.
- Requires careful design of caps, sites, and performance standards.
- Requires coordination with regional partners for larger workloads.

**Fit with community control:**

- Strong: the small local project can be directly governed by FCIIA and FCA.
- Residents can vote on caps, expansions, and how community revenues are used.

## 3. Option C – “Somewhere else” + fiber (no data center in Festus for now)

**What it is:**

- No data center campus in Festus.
- Focus on:
  - High-quality fiber and carrier connections to regional hubs.
  - Great last-mile connectivity for homes, schools, and businesses.

**Possible upsides:**

- Avoids local noise, water, and land-use impacts from a data center.
- Still supports tech, remote work, and advanced manufacturing that mainly need bandwidth.

**Risks/tradeoffs:**

- Little or no direct DC tax base.
- Less local experience with operating digital infrastructure.

**Fit with community control:**

- Very low risk locally; decisions shift to regional and state levels.
- Festus still benefits from doing connectivity and governance work now (so it is ready later).

## 4. A cautious, practical path for Festus

A realistic approach does not have to pick one option forever. For example:

1. **Codify “no hyperscale in city limits for now.”**  
   Set clear MW and site-size caps in zoning, with any change requiring resident approval.
2. **Pilot one small, “good neighbor” modular data center under FCIIA + Civic Assembly rules.**  
   Use this to test covenants, oversight, and community benefit design.
3. **Rely heavily on regional data centers and cloud via fiber.**  
   Pursue a regional/utility-style data center outside the most sensitive areas, where Festus can be a partner rather than the sole host.
4. **Allow only edge/micro sites elsewhere in town.**  
   Limit them to substations and industrial corridors, with strict standards for noise, water, and appearance.

The point is not to chase "data centers at any cost," but to match **connectivity and economic benefits** to Festus' size, risk tolerance, and community values.
