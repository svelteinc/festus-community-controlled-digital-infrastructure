# Festus Area Corridor – Growth with Guardrails (One-Page Handout, Draft v1)

> Plain-language summary for residents and civic volunteers. Not an adopted plan, ordinance, or legal advice.

## 1. What is the Festus area corridor?

- A string of small cities and towns along **I‑55** and **US‑67/MO‑21**:
  - Herculaneum, Pevely, Festus, Crystal City, **Hematite-area communities**, Olympian Village and De Soto.
- About **35–45 minutes from St. Louis**.
- Mix of:
  - Older river and highway towns.
  - New subdivisions and big-box retail.
  - Industrial sites and open land that outside investors are watching.

## 2. What is changing right now?

- **James Hardie (Crystal City)** is building a large, long-term advanced manufacturing plant.
- A **bitcoin mining facility near the Armory off Highway P in Hematite** is permitted under **Jefferson County**, next to an Ameren substation.
- A **240‑acre site by I‑55, north of 67 and west of CC near Festus** has been marketed as a possible **data center campus**.
- **Timber Creek Resort / Holiday Inn Club Vacations (De Soto)** is being **auctioned Dec. 1**, so its long‑term future is uncertain.

All of these sit in the same corridor. The question is: **do we grow on our terms, or on someone else's?**

## 3. The idea: "Growth with Guardrails"

Residents have said they want:
- **Good jobs and a stronger tax base**, without selling the town off.
- **Quiet neighborhoods, safe roads, clean water and trees**.
- **Open, honest deals**, not surprises.

"Growth with Guardrails" means:
- Welcoming **good-fit employers and carefully sized digital infrastructure**.
- Using **strong rules and community-controlled entities** (like FDIA/FCIC and a city‑wide civic authority and assembly) to protect:
  - Noise, water, and traffic.
  - Floodplains, tree cover, and views.
  - The city's general fund and long‑term flexibility.

## 4. What this corridor strategy tries to do

1. **Name the corridor clearly** so Festus and surrounding small cities and towns (including De Soto and nearby communities) see themselves as a shared region, not just exits.
2. **Prioritize anchors that fit small-city life**:
   - Advanced manufacturing (like James Hardie and similar employers).
   - Health care, schools, and main-street businesses.
   - Multiple modest tourism and outdoor recreation nodes (not one giant resort that can vanish overnight).
   - Smaller, transparent **micro/modular data centers** under strict rules, instead of one off hyperscale bets.
3. **Draw bright lines** around what the community will not accept:
   - No uncontrolled hyperscale data center build-out inside city limits.
   - No opaque, one‑off tax deals that risk the city budget.
   - No surprise changes to noise, water, or traffic protections without a public, resident-led process.

## 5. How residents stay in charge

Under the emerging **Festus Civic Infrastructure & Innovation Authority (FCIIA)** and **Festus Civic Assembly (FCA)** concepts:

- Big, long‑term deals (like a large data center campus or major expansion) would:
  - Sit inside a **public-purpose entity** (FDIA/FCIC) that holds land and long‑term covenants.
  - Be subject to **clear guardrails** and **reserved matters** that require supermajority and citizen-assembly support.
- Expansions of digital infrastructure above a certain megawatt level would:
  - **Trigger an FCA vote** and transparent modeling of jobs, noise, water, traffic, trees and city finances.
  - Be compared side-by-side with alternatives (e.g., doing nothing, focusing on manufacturing, focusing on fiber and small edge sites only).

In short: **no large digital project moves forward in the corridor without an informed, structured say from residents.**

## 6. How this relates to the Highway P bitcoin site

- The **Highway P bitcoin mining facility near the Armory in Hematite** is a **separate private project**, approved through **Jefferson Countys** process.
- It is **not part of the Festus CCDI project** and is **not controlled by FDIA/FCIC or the proposed city-wide civic authority and assembly**.
- It is, however, a useful **lesson**:
  - It shows how quickly digital infrastructure can appear near substations.
  - It shows the importance of **noise rules, traffic planning, water management and long‑term transparency**.

The corridor strategy assumes other counties and cities may make different choices. Festus and surrounding communities in this corridor can still **set a different standard** inside their limits.

## 7. What "success" could look like in 10–15 years

If "growth with guardrails" works, the corridor could have:

- **Stable, long‑term employers** (like James Hardie and similar plants) offering good wages.
- **Revived main streets** in Festus, Crystal City and De Soto, with more local shops and services.
- **Safer, calmer neighborhoods** because heavy traffic and noisy industrial uses are kept where they belong and properly buffered.
- **A few carefully sized, well‑governed digital sites** that:
  - Are quiet by design, or well‑buffered.
  - Use reasonable amounts of water and power.
  - Share upside with the community through fees or revenue-sharing, without putting the city budget at risk.
- **Multiple recreation and tourism nodes** (Timber Creek successor use, riverfront, trailheads, etc.) instead of betting the corridor on one brand.

## 8. How you can plug in

- **Residents and civic volunteers**:
  - Read the FAQ and corridor strategy notes.
  - Show up when the city tests new guardrail rules or considers new projects.
  - Ask for clear comparisons: "this deal vs. no deal vs. a smaller/safer alternative".
- **City leaders, PNZ and Council**:
  - Use the corridor strategy and guardrail model as a starting point for ordinance language, RFQs/RFPs and negotiations.
  - Require any major digital infrastructure proposal to run through **transparent, public modeling** and **resident-facing explanations** before decisions.

This corridor is already changing. The core choice is whether that change **happens to** Festus and its surrounding communities, or **with** residents clearly in charge.
