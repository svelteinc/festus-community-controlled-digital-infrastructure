# Questions for PNZ and City Council on Data Center Proposals (Draft v1)

> **Draft for residents.** These questions are meant to be calm, specific, and factfinding. They work whether you are for, against, or undecided on a project.

---

## 1. Revenue and incentives

1. **"Can you show the exact schedule behind the headline tax number?"**  
   If someone claims "$3040 million" in local tax revenue, ask:
   - Over how many years is that counted?
   - Which taxes (city, county, schools) are included?
   - How much is gross vs net of incentives?

2. **"What Chapter 100 or other abatements are being used?"**  
   - What percentage of real and personal property tax is abated, and for how long?
   - Are there state data center incentives wiping out sales tax on construction and equipment?

3. **"What is the *guaranteed* annual revenue to the City of Festus?"**  
   - Not the big marketing number, but the **actual cash** the city expects to receive each year, after abatements.
   - Is there any **contractual minimum** or "floor" the city can count on?

4. **"Is there a way for the community to earn revenue besides conventional tax incentives?"**  
   - For example, ground rent for the land, or perMW community fees paid to a local authority.

## 2. Utilities, power, and water

5. **"How much power (MW) will this facility draw at full buildout?"**  
   - What upgrades to the grid or substations are required, and who pays for them?

6. **"Will residential utility customers see higher rates because of this project?"**  
   - If not, how is that protected in writing?
   - Is there any special fee or contribution from the project to offset grid and infrastructure costs?

7. **"How much water will be used, and what happens during drought or peak demand?"**  
   - Are there caps, reuse requirements, or shutdown rules in extreme conditions?

## 3. Jobs and community benefits

8. **"How many permanent onsite jobs are guaranteed, in writing?"**  
   - How many are fulltime, with benefits?
   - Are there local hiring or training commitments?

9. **"What is the plan to connect Festus residents to those jobs?"**  
   - Partnerships with local schools, unions, or training programs?

10. **"Are there other community benefits (beyond taxes) written into the deal?"**  
    - For example, funds for parks, schools, infrastructure, or rate relief.

## 4. Oversight, covenants, and longterm control

11. **"Who owns the land and the core contracts?"**  
    - Is there a local public entity (like an authority or corporation) that holds the land and covenants on behalf of the community?

12. **"What protections exist for noise, light, water, and traffic  and how are they enforced?"**  
    - Are there measurable standards, monitoring, and penalties for violations?

13. **"What decisions require public hearings or a supermajority vote?"**  
    - For example, selling land, expanding the project, or relaxing protections.

14. **"What happens if the operator wants to sell or if the project underperforms?"**  
    - Can the community step in, or are we locked into a bad deal?

You do not have to be a technical or financial expert to ask these questions.  
The goal is simple: **clear numbers, clear protections, and clear accountability** before any decision is made.
