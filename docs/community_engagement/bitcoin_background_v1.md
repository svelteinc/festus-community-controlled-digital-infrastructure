# Bitcoin – Theoretical, Abstract, and Practical Realities (Draft v1)

> This document explains Bitcoin from three angles – theoretical, abstract, and practical – and surfaces both the strongest arguments **for** and **against** it. It is not investment advice and is written for general civic and policy discussion.

## 1. What Bitcoin is trying to do

Bitcoin is an attempt to create a digital form of money that:

- Has a fixed supply (21 million coins).
- Is not directly controlled by any government or company.
- Can be sent peer to peer without banks.

You can think of it as:

- A protocol for moving value over the internet.
- A monetary asset, sometimes called "digital gold".
- A social and political project that questions existing monetary systems.

Supporters see it as a way to protect savings from inflation, censorship, and bank failures. Critics see it as a volatile speculative asset with heavy environmental and social costs.

## 2. Theoretical foundations

### 2.1 Monetary theory

Bitcoin reacts against two older models of money:

- Fiat money (dollars, euros): supply can be expanded by central banks and governments.
- Commodity money (gold, silver): supply is constrained by the physical world.

Bitcoin tries to combine gold-like scarcity with digital portability:

- Supply is hard-capped at 21 million coins.
- New coins are issued on a fixed schedule that halves roughly every four years.

Supporters argue this makes Bitcoin "sound money" that cannot be inflated by politics. Critics argue a fixed supply can encourage hoarding, limit monetary policy in crises, and make the system dependent on speculation.

### 2.2 Cryptography, blockchain, and proof of work

Bitcoin uses:

- Public and private keys to sign transactions.
- A blockchain, where each block of transactions references the last.
- Proof of work mining, where specialized computers compete to solve a puzzle.

The puzzle is intentionally hard and uses real electricity. The winner adds the next block and earns new coins and fees.

Supporters say this creates a tamper-resistant ledger that does not depend on trusting a single institution. Critics say it creates a system that burns large amounts of energy to maintain a financial asset whose value is uncertain.

### 2.3 Incentives and game theory

Bitcoin assumes that miners, node operators, and users will act in their own economic interest:

- Miners earn more by following the rules than by attacking the network.
- Users and full nodes refuse changes that inflate supply or break basic rules.

In the best case, this creates a stable, neutral system that is hard to censor or corrupt. In the worst case, mining power and infrastructure can concentrate in a small number of hands or jurisdictions that can be pressured or captured.

## 3. Abstract and philosophical frames

### 3.1 Bitcoin as digital gold

Bitcoin is often framed as a long-term store of value:

- Scarce and verifiable.
- Easy to move across borders.
- Not tied to any one country.

Supporters see it as a hedge against inflation and political risk. Critics note that its price has been extremely volatile and often tracks broader risk appetite, which makes it a fragile store of value for everyday households.

### 3.2 Bitcoin as political and ideological project

Bitcoin attracts:

- People skeptical of central banks and fiat currencies.
- Advocates of privacy, censorship resistance, and financial sovereignty.
- Human rights groups who use it when bank accounts are frozen or surveilled.

At the same time, it can be used to evade capital controls, taxes, or sanctions, and to move money for illicit purposes. It also raises questions about inequality, because early adopters can accumulate large holdings before wider adoption.

### 3.3 Bitcoin as energy-backed record

Some argue that proof of work converts physical energy into a secure global record.

Supporters claim this energy cost is what makes the ledger difficult to rewrite and gives it credibility. Critics counter that there may be more efficient ways to secure digital systems and that any large discretionary energy use must be weighed against climate and local community impacts.

## 4. Practical realities

### 4.1 Everyday use

To use Bitcoin, people need a wallet and basic key management:

- Non-custodial wallets give users direct control but are unforgiving of mistakes.
- Custodial services hold coins on behalf of users but reintroduce traditional risks like hacks and insolvency.

For small, frequent payments, Bitcoin on its main chain can be slow and costly. Layer two systems such as the Lightning Network try to address this, but they add complexity and are still evolving.

### 4.2 Mining, facilities, and local impacts

Industrial-scale mining facilities:

- Use large numbers of specialized machines (ASICs).
- Seek out cheap or stranded energy sources.
- Create constant noise and heat and require cooling and land.

Best case, mining can monetize underused energy, help stabilize grids, or support renewable projects. Worst case, it can strain local infrastructure, raise noise and environmental concerns, and leave a community with an empty shell if prices fall and operators leave.

### 4.3 Regulation and state response

Governments respond in mixed ways:

- Some legalize and regulate exchanges and treat Bitcoin as a taxable asset.
- Others restrict mining or trading or cut off banking access to crypto firms.

Bitcoin is designed to be hard to shut down globally, but states still control the key gateways where people turn local currency into Bitcoin and back.

## 5. Environmental realities

Bitcoin mining consumes significant electricity. The exact mix of fossil and renewable energy depends on where miners locate.

Supporters stress that miners seek low-cost or wasted energy and can act as flexible demand that turns off when grids are stressed. Critics stress that global emissions, local air quality, noise, and land use all matter, and that renewable energy used for mining could instead displace fossil fuels elsewhere.

Communities hosting mining facilities must weigh jobs and revenue against long-term environmental and quality-of-life costs.

## 6. Best and worst cases

In the best case, Bitcoin matures into a neutral, widely held store of value and settlement layer:

- A check on undisciplined monetary policy.
- A tool for people under repressive regimes or unstable banking systems.
- A backbone for new, more transparent financial infrastructure.

In the worst case, Bitcoin remains mostly a speculative asset:

- With large boom and bust cycles that harm late entrants.
- With environmental and local harms that outweigh its benefits.
- With concentrated ownership and control, despite its decentralized narrative.

## 7. Questions for communities and policymakers

When evaluating Bitcoin-related activity, communities can ask:

- Who bears financial risk if prices stay low for years?
- How much power and water will mining or related facilities use, and who pays for upgrades?
- What concrete, durable benefits do residents receive beyond short-term rent or hype?
- How will regulation, taxation, and consumer protection keep pace with the technology?

Bitcoin is a serious experiment in digital money. It offers real potential benefits and carries real costs and risks. Understanding all three layers – theoretical, abstract, and practical – is essential before making policy or investment decisions around it.
