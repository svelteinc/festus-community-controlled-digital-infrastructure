# Festus CCDI – Facebook Group Explainer (Draft v1)

Below is a draft post you can share in a Festus Facebook group to introduce the idea in plain language.

## Short Post Version

**Headline:**
A community-controlled way for Festus to host digital infrastructure.

**Post text:**
We're exploring a new way for Festus to host modern digital infrastructure (like data centers) while keeping our community in control.

The basic idea:
- The city, through a new public entity (FDIA/FCIC), keeps control of the land and the rules.
- A private operator pays to build and run the facility at its own risk.
- We lock in strict protections on noise, water, and environmental impact.
- The community gets predictable revenue (ground rent and small usage-based fees) instead of just one-off deals.

This is still a draft proposal for discussion, not a done deal. We want community feedback early, especially on protections and how any revenues should be used.

If you're interested in the details (governance, financing, etc.), we have a public writeup and are happy to share and discuss.

## Longer Post / Thread Version

We're working on a **Festus Community-Controlled Digital Infrastructure (CCDI)** proposal.

**What problem are we trying to solve?**
Many communities get approached about big digital projects (data centers, etc.) but feel like they must choose between economic benefits and quality of life. Deals can be opaque, rushed, and hard to undo.

**What's different about this approach?**
- Festus would create a local public entity (FDIA/FCIC) to hold the project land and set the ground rules.
- Private partners would bring capital and expertise to build and operate facilities.
- We would bake in clear protections on noise, water, traffic, and environment from the start.
- The community would receive ongoing, transparent revenue rather than just up-front incentives.

**Who makes decisions?**
A community-controlled board (FDIA/FCIC) would:
- Hold the land and key contracts.
- Enforce covenants on noise, water use, and environmental performance.
- Approve any major expansion or changes to the rules.

Certain big decisions (like selling land or relaxing protections) would require a strong supermajority and citizen representation on the board.

**How does the money work?**
The concept is:
- A private operator funds most of the construction and operations.
- Lenders and investors are paid from project revenues.
- Festus (through FDIA/FCIC) earns ground rent and small per‑use fees.

This way, the project, not the city's general fund, is designed to bear the financial risk.

**Where is this now?**
This is a **draft framework**, not a final deal. There are no private partners selected and no binding commitments. We're sharing early so residents can see the logic, ask questions, and point out risks or improvements.

If you'd like to read the detailed governance and financing writeups, or if you see issues we should address, comment here or reach out. The goal is to build something that works for Festus first, and only then invite private capital to plug into it.
