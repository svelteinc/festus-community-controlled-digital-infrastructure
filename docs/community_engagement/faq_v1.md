# Festus CCDI – Community FAQ (Draft v1)

> **Note:** This FAQ is a draft to support discussion. It describes a possible structure, not a final deal.

---

## 1. What is the Festus CCDI project?

It is a proposal to create a **community-controlled platform** for modern digital infrastructure in Festus. The idea is to:

- Keep control of the land and core rules in local hands (through FDIA/FCIC).
- Let a private operator build and run facilities at its own risk.
- Lock in protections on noise, water, traffic, and environment.
- Provide stable, transparent revenue streams to the community.

---

## 2. Is this already happening? Is there a specific company?

No. This is a **framework** for how Festus *could* structure a future deal. There is no selected operator and no binding agreement. The goal is to share the framework early so residents can react before any deal is on the table.

---

## 3. Will this be noisy, use a lot of water, or harm the environment?

Those concerns are exactly why the project is structured around **covenants** and **community oversight**.

The proposal includes:

- Noise limits and monitoring.
- Water use caps and reporting.
- Environmental performance standards (e.g., emissions, waste, traffic management).
- Community & Environment committee oversight under the FDIA/FCIC.

Details would be finalized with technical studies and written into binding covenants and contracts before any project moves forward.

---

## 4. Does this raise taxes or put the city budget at risk?

The intent is **not** to put the citys general fund at risk.

- The private operator is expected to finance construction and operations.
- Any debt would be secured by the project, not the citys general credit.
- The city (through FDIA/FCIC) would collect ground rent and small usage-based fees.

Exact terms would be negotiated and reviewed with legal and financial advisors, but the framework is designed so that **the project bears the risk, not the everyday budget for city services**.

---

## 5. Who is in charge?

A proposed public entity called **FDIA/FCIC** would:

- Hold the land and key contracts.
- Enforce noise, water, and environmental covenants.
- Manage and transparently distribute community revenues.

The FDIA/FCIC board would include city appointees, local institutions, citizen representatives, and a technical expert, with **strong voting rules** for big decisions.

City Council would still control zoning, permits, and any tools like TIF or tax abatements.

---

## 6. How does the community benefit financially?

The community benefits through:

- **Ground rent** paid to FDIA/FCIC for use of the land.
- **Small per-use or revenue-based fees** that scale with the project.

Over time, some of these revenues could support **plain-vanilla community bonds**, giving residents and local institutions a way to invest in the platform under conventional rules.

---

## 7. Is this a crypto or token scheme?

No. The core proposal is based on **conventional, boring finance** and public-private partnership tools.

There is an **optional later phase** where:

- Standard community bonds (if issued) could be represented by tokens.
- Tokens would be a **digital wrapper** on top of legally recognized bonds.
- All existing securities laws and protections would still apply.

If tokenization ever happens, it would be **clearly explained, opt-in, and secondary** to the conventional structure.

---

## 8. How can residents influence this?

Residents can:

- Participate in **public meetings** and comment periods.
- Engage through online forums (like the Festus Facebook group).
- Apply for or encourage strong candidates for citizen board seats.
- Provide feedback on how community revenues should be used (e.g., infrastructure, schools, tax relief).

The whole point of sharing this framework early is to **invite critique and ideas** before anything is finalized.

## 9. Where can I read more?

Detailed documents on governance, capital structure, and community engagement are available in the public repository for this project. They are written in plain English where possible, with summaries and disclaimers to clarify what is draft and what would need formal legal/financial work.
