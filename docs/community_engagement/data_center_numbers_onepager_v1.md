# Festus Data Center – Numbers One‑Pager (Draft v1)

> **Draft for discussion only.** These are simple, order‑of‑magnitude examples to explain trade‑offs. They are **not** predictions about any specific project and **not** financial advice.

## 1. What critics are rightly worried about

In many places, big data center deals work like this:

- **Heavy tax abatements** (e.g., Chapter 100) reduce real and personal property taxes by 90–100% for 15–20 years.
- **State data center incentives** wipe out sales tax on construction materials and equipment.
- The company may advertise a large "gross" tax number over decades, but **the city’s actual annual take can be much smaller**.
- The project can put **strain on power and water**, with residents worried about higher rates.
- Promised permanent jobs can shrink from "hundreds" to a few dozen.

Those concerns are valid and deserve real numbers, not slogans.

## 2. A simple comparison frame (not a forecast)

Instead of arguing about one headline number, it helps to ask:

1. **What does the city actually get, every year, in writing?**
2. **Who carries the financial risk: the project or the general fund?**
3. **Are protections on noise, water, and environment hard‑wired into contracts?**

Our framework (FDIA/FCIC) aims to:

- Put land and covenants in a **community‑controlled entity**.
- Use **ground rent and per‑MW fees** as a transparent community revenue stream.
- Keep project debt **off the city’s general balance sheet**.

Example, purely for illustration (round numbers):

- A 20 MW facility.
- Community fee design:
  - Ground rent: $50,000 per MW per year.
  - Usage/community fee: $10,000 per MW per year.

That structure would target on the order of:

- 20 MW × ($50k + $10k) ≈ **$1.2 million per year** in community revenue,
  **contractually tied to the project**, separate from whatever utility taxes apply.

You could choose higher or lower numbers. The point is that:

- The community share is **explicit and negotiated up front**.
- The fee formula is **easy to explain to residents**.
- Changes to fees or protections would require **public decisions**, not back‑room deals.

## 3. What this does *not* claim

- It does **not** claim that any current proposal in Festus has these terms.
- It does **not** assert that the city will or should agree to any specific numbers.
- It does **not** replace the need for professional financial and legal review.

This one‑pager is simply a tool to:

- Translate Facebook comments about "$30–40M" vs "$4–6M" into **concrete questions**.
- Show that Festus can ask for **clear, enforceable community revenue**, instead of relying only on conventional abatements and optimistic projections.
