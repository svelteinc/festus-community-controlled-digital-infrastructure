## Slide 1 – Title & purpose

**"Festus Area Corridor – Growth with Guardrails"**

- "We are here to talk about the **Festus Area Corridor** – the band of small
  cities and towns from Herculaneum down through Pevely, Festus, Crystal City,
  Hematite-area communities, Olympian Village and De Soto.
- "Outside investors already see this place. The question is **on whose terms**
  we grow."
- "Tonight is about a simple idea: **growth with guardrails** – welcoming good
  projects, while protecting our neighborhoods, water, and long-term budget."

## Slide 2 – The corridor on the map

- "This is not just one exit or one town. It's a **connected corridor** along
  I-55 and US-67/MO-21, about 35–45 minutes from St. Louis."
- "Each place brings something: industrial land and power, historic
  downtowns, neighborhoods, schools, and outdoor assets."
- "If we plan together, we can get better projects and avoid being played off
  against each other."

## Slide 3 – What's happening right now

- "There are already **big moves** underway here:"
  - "James Hardie in Crystal City – a major advanced manufacturing plant."
  - "A bitcoin mining facility near the Armory off Highway P in Hematite."
  - "A 240-acre I-55 site near Festus marketed as a data center campus."
  - "Timber Creek Resort near De Soto being auctioned, with its future
     uncertain."
- "These are signs that capital is coming. Our choice is whether **we set the
  rules**, or we just react."

## Slide 4 – What residents say they want

- "When you listen to people across Festus and the surrounding corridor, you
  hear very similar things:"
  - "They want **good jobs and a stronger tax base**, not just speculation."
  - "They want **quiet, safe neighborhoods** and **clean water and trees**."
  - "They want **transparent, honest deals** – no surprises."
- "This strategy is built to match those priorities."

## Slide 5 – What we are trying to avoid

- "We are **not** trying to become a hyperscale data center park or a place for
  one-off opaque deals."
- "We are trying to avoid:'"
  - "Uncontrolled hyperscale data center sprawl."
  - "One-off tax deals that put the **general fund** at risk."
  - "Noisy, water-intensive, visually harsh projects right next to
     neighborhoods."
  - "Betting the corridor on a single resort, a single employer, or a single
     brand."

## Slide 6 – The "Growth with Guardrails" idea

- "Our proposal is **growth with guardrails**."
- "We welcome **good-fit employers** and **carefully sized digital projects** –
  but **inside strong rules**."
- "Those guardrails cover noise, water, traffic, lighting, trees, floodplains,
  and also how much risk we take onto the city budget."
- "They also include **resident say** before big, irreversible decisions."

## Slide 7 – The tools: FDIA/FCIC + civic authority and assembly

- "To make this real, we use a new civic 'operating system':"
  - "At the **project level**, FDIA/FCIC holds the land and the long-term
     covenants, and signs leases with operators. That keeps core control and
     risk where we need it."
  - "At the **city-wide level**, the Festus Civic Infrastructure & Innovation
     Authority and a Festus Civic Assembly set standards and give residents a
     structured voice on big changes."
- "Together, this lets us say 'yes' to good deals with confidence, and 'no' to
  bad ones, without drama."

## Slide 8 – What this means for digital infrastructure

- "For digital infrastructure like data centers and edge sites, this means:"
  - "**Yes** to smaller, well-buffered **micro/modular data centers** and edge
     sites that meet strict performance standards and share upside with the
     community."
  - "**No / not now** to hyperscale campuses inside small-city limits that would
     overload power or water and lock us into a single risky bet."
- "We get the **benefits of connectivity and compute** without turning the
  corridor into an industrial heat sink."

## Slide 9 – Lessons from the Highway P bitcoin site

- "The bitcoin site near the Armory in Hematite is **not** part of this
  project – it's a separate, county-permitted facility."
- "It teaches us a few things:"
  - "How quickly digital infrastructure appears near substations."
  - "Why **noise, traffic, and water standards** matter."
  - "Why we want a **different playbook** inside Festus and other small-city
     corridor communities than what we've seen at the Highway P site."

## Slide 10 – What success looks like in 10–15 years

- "If we get this right, a decade from now this corridor looks like:"
  - "Multiple **advanced manufacturing anchors** like James Hardie and peers."
  - "**Revived main streets** with more local businesses."
  - "A few modest, well-governed **digital sites**, not one giant campus."
  - "Several **tourism and outdoor recreation nodes** – Timber Creek's
     successor use, riverfront, trails – instead of betting everything on one
     resort."
  - "A proven **civic operating system** that other cities can copy."

## Slide 11 – Decisions coming up

- "For Mayor, Council, PNZ, and partners, the near-term decisions are:"
  - "Whether to adopt clear **zoning and ordinance guardrails** for digital
     infrastructure."
  - "How to treat future proposals at the **240-acre I-55 site**."
  - "What to signal about desired uses around **Timber Creek** after the
     auction."
  - "How and when to stand up the **FCIIA and Civic Assembly** structures."

## Slide 12 – How we will engage residents

- "We will not move big digital projects quietly."
- "We will use FAQs, one-pagers, and corridor explainers, plus workshops and
  public hearings, to lay out options side-by-side."
- "The commitment is simple: **no large, long-term digital project without a
  structured resident say.**"

## Slide 13 – What we need from partners

- "From state and regional partners, utilities, and investors, we need:"
  - "Respect for the **local guardrails and civic structures**."
  - "Joint planning of infrastructure upgrades – power, water, roads – that
     match our scale and support multiple good projects."
  - "Transparency on long-term jobs, operations, and impacts."

## Slide 14 – Closing

- "The Festus Area Corridor is already changing."
- "We can either **react** to outside agendas, or **lead** with a clear,
  community-controlled playbook."
- "Growth with guardrails is how we protect what people value here while still
  saying 'yes' to the right kind of growth."
