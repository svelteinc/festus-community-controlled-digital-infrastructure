# Festus Area Corridor – Growth with Guardrails (Draft v1)

> Concept note for discussion only. Not an adopted plan, ordinance, or legal advice.

## 1. 2025 reality snapshot

### 1.1 Geography

- Herculaneum, Pevely, Festus, Crystal City and Hematite line up along **I-55**, with Olympian Village and other small communities in between.
- De Soto anchors the **US-67 / MO-21** side of the corridor.
- Together they form a small-city / town corridor about 35–45 minutes from St. Louis.

### 1.2 Key projects and anchors (late 2025)

- **Festus 240-acre annexation at I-55/67**  
  Annexed into Festus for a possible data center campus. Residents have raised concerns about noise, secrecy, and long-term risk. No public, named hyperscale tenant has been announced; governance and guardrails are still in play.

- **James Hardie Industries – Crystal City**  
  James Hardie, a global fiber-cement siding and building materials company, is building a **~1.25 million sq ft facility** on and around the former Festus Municipal Airport property in Crystal City. Public estimates suggest **around 238 jobs** with an **average wage near $34/hour**, making it one of the largest corporate investments in Jefferson County.

- **Hematite / Highway P bitcoin facility**  
  A private bitcoin mining project near the Missouri National Guard Armory off Highway P in Hematite, permitted through Jefferson County, sits just outside Festus and Crystal City but inside the lived-in corridor. It shows how **uncoordinated digital infrastructure can arrive wherever zoning and utilities allow**, even when cities are not in the driver’s seat.

- **Timber Creek Resort / Holiday Inn Club Vacations – De Soto**  
  Timber Creek at De Soto has functioned as a vacation resort and timeshare node on US-67. As of late 2025, Holiday Inn Club Vacations is exiting the property and the resort is being **auctioned for sale on Dec. 1**, with the buyer and future use still unknown. Timber Creek is **no longer a guaranteed long-term anchor** in its current form.

- **De Soto and Festus/Crystal City downtowns**  
  De Soto has a modern comprehensive plan and ongoing flood-resilience work, plus a walkable main street and neighborhoods. Festus and Crystal City already function as a regional hub for health care, schools, and services, with historic downtowns that can be strengthened with modest, visible improvements.

**Bottom line:** This is a corridor with serious stakes: a major new advanced manufacturing plant (James Hardie), a contested 240-acre annexation, a resort asset in transition (Timber Creek), and an existing bitcoin facility at Hematite.

## 2. Strategic thesis – what kind of growth, and on whose terms?

> Festus and its surrounding small cities and towns should grow as a **small-city advanced manufacturing and lifestyle corridor** with **limited, community-ruled digital infrastructure** – not as an uncontrolled hyperscale data center or speculative resort dumping ground.

Four pillars:

1. **Advanced & specialty manufacturing**, anchored by James Hardie and similar employers.
2. **Neighborhood-scale digital/tech infrastructure** (micro data centers, edge, AI services) with strict caps and covenants.
3. **Tourism, outdoors, and lifestyle**, with multiple recreation nodes (Timber Creek area future, river, trails, Ozark edge) instead of one fragile branded resort.
4. **Main Street + local services**, with strong small downtowns and everyday amenities.

Everything else – hyperscale DCs, opaque resorts, speculative mega-projects – must fit **within** community guardrails, not drive the strategy.

## 3. Quick wins (0–24 months)

### 3.1 Guardrails first

- Adopt aligned **digital infrastructure standards** in Festus and in surrounding corridor communities (including De Soto and other nearby small cities and towns) that:
  - Cap data center size by right (e.g., 3–5 MW per site; bigger requires a Civic Assembly vote and FCIIA-style approval).
  - Impose strict noise, water, lighting, and visual-buffer standards.
  - Require basic operator transparency (operator type, use, MW size); no “mystery boxes.”
- Stand up a **Festus Civic Infrastructure & Innovation Authority (FCIIA)** to hold strategic land, negotiate big deals, and embed resident approval for major changes.
- Pilot a **Festus Civic Assembly** that:
  - Votes on use of a modest community fund.
  - Must approve any major up-zoning or expansion of the 240-acre data center tract.

### 3.2 Economic “easy wins”

1. **Good-neighbor micro data center (3–5 MW)**  
   - Site a small, tightly conditioned modular data center on a suitable industrial parcel or a corner of the 240 acres.
   - Use FCIIA as landlord, with covenants on noise, water, truck routing, transparency, and community payments.

2. **US-67 / MO-110 flex/advanced manufacturing building**  
   - Build a 20–40k sq ft flex/industrial building near the US-67 / MO-21 side of the corridor (for example near De Soto) to attract fabrication, components, prefab, or light advanced manufacturing.
   - Use conservative incentives tied to job quality, local hiring, and training, not blank abatements.

3. **Timber Creek area as a flexible tourism/lifestyle node**  
   - Treat the Timber Creek site and surroundings as a multi-use recreation node after the Dec. 1 auction, not a single-brand bet.
   - Priorities as ownership clarifies:
     - Preserve outdoor and trail value where feasible.
     - Encourage small lodges/cabins, retreat centers, and outdoor-oriented uses.
     - Consider public or quasi-public control of key parcels via FCIIA or partners if realistic.

4. **Main Street and neighborhood visible wins**  
   - Use early community-fund dollars and small grants for 5–10 highly visible projects in Festus and surrounding small cities and towns in the corridor, including Crystal City, De Soto, Hematite-area neighborhoods, and nearby communities (crosswalks, park upgrades, trees, traffic calming, small façade grants).

## 4. Medium-term plays (3–8 years)

- **Advanced manufacturing corridor:** Add 2–4 more flex/industrial buildings along US-67 and near the I-55/James Hardie zone, triggered only when vacancy is low. Focus on suppliers and peers to James Hardie and other high-quality employers.
- **Housing with guardrails:** Allow more townhomes, small apartments, and mixed-use near jobs and downtowns, with incentives only when projects are walkable and include units affordable to local workers and seniors.
- **Regional energy and resilience:** Coordinate with utilities, the county, and nearby cities on future clean, firm power and microgrids for key sites, avoiding hype-driven mega-projects.

## 5. Hard guardrails

- **Impact first, incentives second:** Require clear analysis showing net fiscal benefit after infrastructure and environmental costs.
- **Performance-based expansion:** Tie future phases of data centers, industrial parks, and large housing to several years of compliance and delivery on jobs, taxes, and community commitments.
- **Citizen veto on weakening protections:** Any move to loosen core protections (noise, water, flood, trees) requires a Civic Assembly vote and supermajority council override with written findings.
- **Radical transparency:** Publish all major agreements and abatements in plain tables, plus an annual “Growth, Jobs & Quality of Life” report.

## 6. Public narrative

> “We’re not anti-growth. We’re anti-**dumb** growth.
> We are choosing **small, testable steps**, with **local jobs and quality of life first**,
> and we’ve hard-wired residents into the control room through the Civic Assembly.
> Nobody is writing blank checks to outside developers.”
