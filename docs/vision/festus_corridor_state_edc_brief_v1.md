# Festus Area Corridor – State & Regional EDC Brief (Draft v1)

> For state and regional economic development partners. Not legal, tax, or investment advice.

## 1. The corridor in one sentence

The **Festus Area Corridor** is a band of small cities and towns in northern Jefferson County, Missouri – including Herculaneum, Pevely, Festus, Crystal City, Hematite-area communities, Olympian Village, De Soto and nearby places – roughly 35–45 minutes from St. Louis, with new advanced manufacturing, changing resort assets, and emerging digital infrastructure pressure.

## 2. Why this corridor matters to the state/region

- **Scale and visibility:**
  - James Hardie’s large investment in Crystal City signals serious long-term manufacturing commitment.
  - The 240-acre I‑55 site near Festus and the bitcoin facility near Highway P in Hematite show investors are targeting power-rich, infrastructure-adjacent land.
- **Risk of misaligned growth:**
  - Without a shared playbook, individual parcels can flip into **noisy, water-intensive, thin-job uses** or speculative resorts that do little for residents.
- **Opportunity for replication:**
  - A successful "growth with guardrails" model here could be exported to other Missouri communities.

## 3. Local strategy: growth with guardrails

Local leaders and residents are advancing a strategy that:

- Prioritizes **advanced/specialty manufacturing**, health care, and main-street services.
- Allows carefully sized, **community-ruled digital infrastructure** (micro/modular data centers, edge sites) with strict performance standards.
- Uses a **civic operating system** – FDIA/FCIC for projects and a city-wide FCIIA/FCA concept – so big decisions require resident involvement and meet pre-set guardrails.
- Treats Timber Creek and similar nodes as part of a **diversified tourism and outdoor network**, not a single-point bet.

## 4. What we are asking from state and regional partners

We are **not** asking for blank checks, speculative mega-projects, or to bypass local guardrails.

We are looking for partners who will:

1. **Align incentives with guardrails**
   - Focus support on projects that:
     - Meet or exceed agreed noise, water, traffic, and tree-cover standards.
     - Deliver durable jobs and career pathways for local residents.
     - Fit within the corridor land-use and resilience strategy.
2. **Co-invest in infrastructure that serves multiple uses**
   - Power, water, and road upgrades that:
     - Support James Hardie-scale employers and their suppliers.
     - Enable smaller, well-governed digital sites.
     - Improve safety and resilience for residents (e.g., substation and road upgrades that reduce outage risk).
3. **Support workforce and institutional capacity**
   - Training pipelines and community-college partnerships aligned with advanced manufacturing and digital operations.
   - Technical assistance to stand up and professionalize entities like FDIA/FCIC and FCIIA/FCA.
4. **Respect the civic operating system**
   - Recognize that projects may require **Festus-area civic assembly involvement** and higher transparency than typical one-off deals.

## 5. What success looks like from your side

For state and regional EDCs, success in the Festus Area Corridor would mean:

- A **visible demonstration project** for how small-city corridors can manage digital and industrial growth.
- A cluster of **high-quality employers** (led by James Hardie and peers) with resilient, modern infrastructure.
- A credible, exportable **governance and finance template** that can reduce risk in other communities.

## 6. How to engage

- Use the **corridor pitch deck outline** (`docs/vision/festus_desoto_corridor_pitch_deck_outline_v1.md`) as a basis for joint briefings.
- Coordinate early on **infrastructure planning** and **incentive design** so offers sent to prospects match local guardrails.
- Consider piloting **state-level support programs** (e.g., planning grants, technical assistance) that help other corridors adopt similar models if this one succeeds.
