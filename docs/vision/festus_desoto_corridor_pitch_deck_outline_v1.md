# Festus Area Corridor – Growth with Guardrails

Deck Outline (Draft v1 for Mayor, Council, EDC)

> This is an outline for a short slide deck (10–15 minutes). Adjust numbers and names as facts change. Not legal or financial advice.

---

## Slide 1 – Title & purpose

- **Title:** Festus Area Corridor – Growth with Guardrails
- **Subtitle:** How we grow on our terms, not someone else's
- **Purpose:**
  - Introduce the corridor as a shared region.
  - Frame current pressures (manufacturing, bitcoin mining, data centers, resort sale).
  - Explain the "growth with guardrails" approach and what decisions are coming.

## Slide 2 – The corridor on the map

- Simple map or schematic showing:
  - Herculaneum, Pevely, Festus, Crystal City and Hematite along **I‑55**.
  - De Soto along **US‑67 / MO‑21**.
  - Key landmarks: I‑55/67/CC, Ameren substations, Timber Creek area.
- Message: "One small‑city corridor ~35–45 minutes from St. Louis."

## Slide 3 – What's happening right now

- **James Hardie (Crystal City)** – major advanced manufacturing investment.
- **Highway P bitcoin site (Hematite)** – private mining project near Armory and Ameren substation under Jefferson County.
- **Festus 240‑acre I‑55 site** – annexed land marketed for potential data center campus.
- **Timber Creek Resort / Holiday Inn Club Vacations (De Soto)** – owner exiting; **property being auctioned Dec. 1**.
- Message: "Investors already see this corridor. The only question is on whose terms we grow."

## Slide 4 – What residents say they want

- From conversations, meetings, and feedback:
  - **Good jobs and stronger tax base**.
  - **Quiet, safe neighborhoods**; reasonable traffic.
  - **Clean water, trees, and protected floodplains**.
  - **Transparent, honest deals** – no surprises.
- Quote or short story if available.

## Slide 5 – What we are trying to avoid

- Uncontrolled hyperscale data center sprawl.
- One-off, opaque tax deals that put the **general fund** at risk.
- Noisy, water‑intensive or visually harsh developments next to neighborhoods without buffers.
- Single-point failure: betting the corridor on one resort, one big employer, or one brand.

## Slide 6 – The "Growth with Guardrails" idea

- **Concept:** Welcome good-fit employers and carefully sized digital projects **inside strong guardrails**.
- Guardrails include:
  - Hard limits and performance standards for **noise, water, traffic, light, and tree cover**.
  - **Floodplain and view protection** around sensitive areas.
  - Clear financial risk boundaries between projects and the **city budget**.
  - Real **resident say** before big, irreversible decisions.

## Slide 7 – The tools: FDIA/FCIC + city-wide civic authority and assembly

- **FDIA/FCIC** (project-level entity):
  - Holds land and long-term covenants for specific sites.
  - Signs leases or concessions with operators.
  - Keeps project risk separate from the city general fund.
- **FCIIA (Festus Civic Infrastructure & Innovation Authority)** and **Festus Civic Assembly (FCA)** (city-wide layer):
  - Set corridor-wide rules and standards.
  - Require **FCA involvement** and supermajority support for any major digital infrastructure expansion or attempt to weaken protections.

## Slide 8 – What this means for digital infrastructure

- **Yes to:**
  - Smaller **micro/modular data centers** or edge sites that:
    - Meet strict noise, water, and traffic standards.
    - Are transparently modeled and governed.
    - Share upside with the community via fees or revenue sharing.
- **No / not now to:**
  - Hyperscale data center campuses inside city limits that would:
    - Overload power or water systems.
    - Lock the city into a single, risky bet.
    - Reduce long-term flexibility for better fits later.

## Slide 9 – Lessons from the Highway P bitcoin site

- Clarify:
  - The **Highway P bitcoin mine** is **not** part of the Festus CCDI project.
  - It is permitted under **Jefferson County** rules.
- What we can learn:
  - How quickly digital infrastructure appears near substations.
  - Why **noise, traffic, and water standards** matter.
  - Why we want a **different playbook** inside Festus and other small-city corridor communities than what we've seen at the Highway P site.

## Slide 10 – What success looks like in 10–15 years

- A corridor with:
  - Multiple **advanced manufacturing anchors** (James Hardie + peers).
  - **Revived main streets** with more local businesses.
  - Several modest, well-buffered **digital sites**, not one massive campus.
  - **Multiple tourism/recreation nodes** (Timber Creek successor use, riverfront, trails).
  - A proven **civic operating system** (FDIA/FCIC + FCIIA/FCA) that other cities can copy.

## Slide 11 – Decisions coming up

- Near-term decisions for Mayor, Council, PNZ, and partners:
  - Whether to adopt **zoning and ordinance guardrails** for data centers and digital infra.
  - How to treat future proposals at the **240‑acre I‑55 site**.
  - What to signal about **desired uses around Timber Creek** once the auction clears.
  - How and when to formally stand up the **FCIIA and FCA** structures.

## Slide 12 – How we will engage residents

- Plan for community engagement:
  - FAQs, one-pagers, and explainers (including the corridor one-page handout).
  - Public workshops and PNZ/Council hearings where options are shown side-by-side.
  - Discussion of trade-offs and alternatives: "no deal vs small deal vs big deal".
- Commitment: **No large, long-term digital project without a structured resident say.**

## Slide 13 – What we need from partners

- From regional and state partners, utilities, and investors:
  - Respect for **local guardrails and civic structures**.
  - Co-design of infrastructure upgrades (power, water, roads) that match our scale.
  - Transparency on long-term operations, jobs, and impacts.

## Slide 14 – Closing

- Restate:
  - The corridor is already changing.
  - Festus and its surrounding small cities and towns can either **react** to outside agendas or **lead** with a clear playbook.
- Call to action:
  - For Council/PNZ: agree on next steps to codify guardrails.
  - For staff/EDC: use this framework in conversations with prospects.
  - For residents: stay involved and help refine the rules.
