# Festus CCDI – Project Vision (Draft v1)

**TL;DR (Plain English)**
- Festus keeps community control over the land and core rules.
- Private partners bring capital and technical expertise to build and run facilities.
- Residents get protections on noise, water, and environment plus a share of the upside.

The Festus Community-Controlled Digital Infrastructure (CCDI) project aims to create a long-lived, community-controlled platform for modern digital infrastructure that:

- Expands the local tax base and economic opportunity.
- Respects and protects residents' quality of life (noise, water, environment).
- Keeps strategic control over land and rules in local hands.
- Attracts private capital and expertise without ceding long-term control.

## Guiding Principles

1. **Community Control of the Platform**
   - Land and core covenants are controlled via FDIA/FCIC, not private operators.

2. **Good-Neighbor Operations**
   - Noise, water, and environmental performance are monitored and enforced.

3. **Transparent, Durable Governance**
   - Clear, public rules for how decisions are made and who holds power.

4. **Conservative, Understandable Finance**
   - Start with familiar instruments and institutions; add innovation later.

5. **Option Value for the Future**
   - Design structures that can support future facilities, technologies, and financing tools.

## Outcomes Sought

- Stable and growing local revenues.
- High-quality jobs and training opportunities.
- Minimal negative externalities to residents.
- A replicable model for other communities.
