# Festus CCDI – Council & Mayor Briefing (One-Page Summary, Draft v1)

> **Status:** Conceptual framework for discussion only. Not a binding deal and not legal, tax, or investment advice.

## 1. What This Is

A proposal for a **community-controlled digital infrastructure platform** in Festus:

- Create a local public entity (FDIA/FCIC) to hold project land and covenants.
- Invite a private operator to **build and run facilities at its own risk** on a long-term ground lease.
- Lock in **clear protections** on noise, water, traffic, and environment.
- Provide **predictable, transparent revenues** to the community over time.

## 2. Why Consider This

- **Economic development** without ceding long-term control of strategic land.
- **Stable revenues** (ground rent + modest usage-based fees) instead of one-off incentives.
- **Community protections** and oversight baked into the structure rather than added later.
- A **replicable model** that can be shared with other communities as a public good.

## 3. Governance Snapshot (FDIA/FCIC)

- 7-member board (draft model):
  - City appointees, local institution, citizen representatives, technical expert, at-large community/economic development seat.
- **Reserved matters** (e.g., land sales, relaxing covenants, major expansions) require:
  - Supermajority vote, and
  - Explicit citizen representation support.
- City Council retains control over **zoning, permits, and fiscal tools** (TIF, abatements, etc.).

## 4. Capital Stack Snapshot (Phase 1)

- City/FDIA/FCIC contributes **land + rules** via a long-term ground lease.
- Private operator funds **most of the build** through:
  - Senior debt from banks/infrastructure lenders.
  - Private equity from the operator/sponsors.
- FDIA/FCIC receives:
  - **Ground rent**, and
  - A small **per-use or revenue-based fee**.
- Optional, later: **plain-vanilla community revenue bonds** backed by FDIA/FCIC revenues.

## 5. Tokenization (Phase 2+, Optional)

- Only after a conventional structure and bonds exist.
- Tokens would be a **digital wrapper** around standard community bonds, not a crypto scheme.
- Any tokenization would follow existing securities rules and be strictly opt-in.

## 6. What Decisions Are Needed Now

At this stage, Council is **not** being asked to approve a specific operator or financing package.

Near-term decisions could include:

1. Whether to **explore and refine** this FDIA/FCIC model with legal and financial advisors.
2. Whether to **engage the public** (e.g., Facebook groups, town halls) on the vision and protections.
3. Whether to authorize staff and counsel to draft:
   - A formal FDIA/FCIC charter/bylaws based on this model.
   - Non-binding term sheet concepts for potential operators.

## 7. Key Safeguards (Draft)

- No sale or long-term encumbrance of land without **supermajority + citizen** support.
- No relaxation of noise, water, or environmental covenants without the same.
- Transparent reporting to Council and the public (annual reports, open meetings, published covenants).

## 8. Next Steps (If Council Is Interested)

1. Direct staff to work with counsel on a **formal governance and entity structure** draft.
2. Commission a **finance/legal review** of the Phase 1 capital stack.
3. Conduct **public engagement** to test and refine the protections and revenue uses.

This briefing is meant to orient decision-makers quickly; the underlying detailed documents are available in the project repository for deeper review.
