# Tokenization & RWA Documentation

This directory is for Phase 2+ work on tokenized community bonds and related real-world asset (RWA) structures.

Use it to describe:
- Legal and regulatory approach for tokenized instruments.
- Technical architecture (e.g., XRPL, Flare, or other chains).
- How tokens map to underlying conventional securities.
- Governance and risk controls for on-chain features.

Tokenization should be treated as a distribution layer on top of a conventional, well-understood capital stack.
