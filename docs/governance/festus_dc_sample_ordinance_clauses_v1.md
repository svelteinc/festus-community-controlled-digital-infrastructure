# Festus Data Center & Edge Compute – Sample Ordinance Clauses (Draft v1)

> **Disclaimer.** This is a policy-oriented draft to support discussion with local counsel and planning staff. It is **not** legal advice and does not reflect current Festus law.

---

## Section 1. Purpose and Intent

(A) The purpose of these provisions is to:

1. Protect public health, safety, and welfare from potential impacts of large-scale data center developments, including noise, water use, traffic, visual impacts, and grid stress.
2. Allow small, well-regulated data center and edge computing facilities that serve local and regional needs.
3. Direct very large or hyperscale data center uses toward regional or utility-scale solutions outside sensitive areas.
4. Align land use decisions involving major digital infrastructure with the community decision-making processes of the Festus Civic Infrastructure & Innovation Authority ("FCIIA") and the Festus Civic Assembly ("FCA"), if established.

(B) These provisions shall be construed to supplement, and not to repeal, other applicable zoning, building, and environmental regulations.

## Section 2. Definitions (sample language)

For purposes of this Article, the following terms shall have the meanings indicated. Final definitions and cross-references shall be drafted by local counsel.

1. **Data Center, General** means a facility used primarily for the storage, management, processing, or transmission of digital data, including associated computer servers, data storage devices, networking equipment, and support infrastructure.

2. **Data Center, Hyperscale** means a Data Center, or group of functionally related Data Centers on contiguous lots under common control, that meets or exceeds any of the following thresholds:
   - A connected electrical load of more than **[X] megawatts (MW)**; or
   - A gross floor area of more than **[Y] square feet**; or
   - More than **[Z] full-size equipment halls** or equivalent enclosed server rooms.

3. **Data Center, Micro/Modular** means a Data Center that:
   - Has a connected electrical load between **[1 and 5] MW**, or such other range as may be specified by ordinance; and
   - Is designed to fit within a light-industrial building or modular compound consistent with the surrounding district.

4. **Edge Compute Facility** means a small facility, often containerized, with:
   - A connected electrical load of less than **[1] MW**; and
   - A floor area below **[A] square feet**, used primarily for caching, telecommunications, local AI inference, industrial controls, or similar functions, and not for hyperscale training or bulk compute.

5. **Total Data Center Load** means the sum of the maximum connected electrical load, in megawatts, of all Data Centers and Edge Compute Facilities located within the City limits.

Thresholds [X], [Y], [Z], [1–5], and [A] are policy choices and must be set by the City through separate action.

## Section 3. Use Regulations (conceptual)

(A) **Hyperscale Data Centers Prohibited.**  
No Data Center, Hyperscale shall be permitted in any zoning district within the City of Festus.

(B) **Micro/Modular Data Centers.**  
Subject to the capacity limits and performance standards of this Article:

1. Data Center, Micro/Modular shall be allowed only as a conditional use in designated Light Industrial and General Industrial districts, as set forth in the City’s use tables.
2. Data Center, Micro/Modular shall be prohibited in all Residential districts, Neighborhood Commercial districts, and other sensitive districts as determined by ordinance.

(C) **Edge Compute Facilities.**  
Subject to the capacity limits and performance standards of this Article:

1. Edge Compute Facilities may be allowed as a permitted or conditional accessory use in Utility, Transportation, and Industrial districts, including on substation sites and large industrial parcels.
2. Edge Compute Facilities shall be prohibited in purely Residential districts except as part of a public utility installation expressly authorized by ordinance or conditional use permit.

## Section 4. Capacity Caps and FCA Triggers (conceptual)

(A) **City-wide Capacity Cap.**  
The Total Data Center Load within the City limits shall not exceed **[C] MW** unless and until:

1. The Festus Civic Assembly (FCA), if established, has approved such increase by a city-wide vote conducted in accordance with applicable ordinances; and
2. The City Council has approved such increase by the affirmative vote of at least **two-thirds (2/3)** of all members, with written findings regarding impacts on infrastructure, environment, and community benefits.

(B) **Site Capacity Cap.**  
No single Data Center, Micro/Modular, Edge Compute Facility, or aggregation of such facilities on contiguous lots under common control shall exceed **[S] MW** of connected load unless and until:

1. FCA has approved such increase by a vote as described in subsection (A); and
2. The City Council has approved such increase as described in subsection (A).

(C) **Conditional Use Findings.**  
In reviewing any conditional use request for a Data Center, Micro/Modular or Edge Compute Facility, the Planning and Zoning Commission and City Council shall consider, in addition to other applicable criteria:

1. Compliance with the performance standards in Section 5; and
2. Cumulative impact on Total Data Center Load relative to the cap in subsection (A).

## Section 5. Performance Standards (summary)

Detailed performance standards should be set forth in a separate section, but at minimum should address:

1. **Noise** – Maximum sound levels at property lines and at nearest dwellings; restrictions on generator testing hours.
2. **Water Use and Cooling** – Preference for air-cooled or low-water designs; caps and monitoring for any water-cooled systems; drought and peak-demand protocols.
3. **Setbacks and Screening** – Minimum setbacks from Residential districts; fencing, landscaping, and visual screening of equipment and yards.
4. **Lighting** – Full cut-off fixtures; limits on up-lighting and skyglow; curfews for non-essential lighting.
5. **Traffic and Access** – Limits on heavy-truck trips; designated loading hours; circulation designed to minimize impacts on residential streets.
6. **Safety and Resilience** – Standards for fuel storage, fire suppression, emergency shut-down, and coordination with local fire and emergency services.

## Section 6. Policy Preference for Regional/Utility-Scale Solutions

(A) It is the policy of the City to encourage very large or hyperscale data center uses to locate in regional or utility-scale facilities outside sensitive areas, where impacts can be more effectively managed.

(B) Where appropriate, the City may participate in such facilities through an authority, joint venture, or similar structure, including but not limited to the Festus Civic Infrastructure & Innovation Authority (FCIIA), if established.

(C) Nothing in this Article shall be construed to obligate the City to approve any particular data center proposal.

This document provides sample language for discussion only. Local counsel should convert these concepts into numbered sections, cross-references, and district-specific use tables consistent with Festus law.
