# Festus City-Wide Civic Authority & Assembly – Concept Note (Draft v1)

> **Purpose.** This document scales the FDIA/FCIC concept into a **city-wide civic operating system** for Festus. It is a draft for discussion only and does **not** represent any official position or legal structure.

---

## 1. From FDIA to a City-Wide Civic Authority (FCIIA)

**Working name:** **Festus Civic Infrastructure & Innovation Authority (FCIIA)**  
(Final name and powers would be drafted and reviewed by attorneys.)

FCIIA is a city-wide public entity that:

- Holds and ground-leases **strategic public land** (opportunity zones, industrial parks, key downtown parcels, riverfront, etc.).
- Manages **major public–private partnerships (PPPs)**, including but not limited to a data-center campus.
- Receives and allocates specific **project-related revenue streams**, such as:
  - Ground rents and PILOTs.
  - TIF/CID/TDD surpluses.
  - Contracted community-benefit payments.
  - Selected grants and special-purpose funds.

In this model, the data-center campus is simply **Program 1** under FCIIA, not the entire mission.

---

## 2. Festus Civic Assembly (FCA) – City-Wide Citizen Layer

**Festus Civic Assembly (FCA)** is a **one-person-one-vote** layer for binding citizen decisions.

Key features:

- Identity: verified Festus residents (KYC once, reused across all FCA votes).
- Geography: tags for wards/neighborhoods to allow **city-wide and district-specific** votes.
- Legal hook: FCIIA bylaws and city ordinances define where FCA decisions are **binding** and where they are **strong advisory** with “comply or explain” rules.

The same FCA platform is reused across:

- Data center and digital infrastructure decisions.
- Other major PPPs.
- Participatory budgeting pools.
- Long-range planning checkpoints.

---

## 3. City-Wide Binding Decision Types (for FCA)

These categories are where FCA decisions are intended to be binding on FCIIA and strongly binding (with high-bar override) on Mayor/Council.

### A. Major Capital Projects

**Trigger:** projects above a set size (e.g., >$2–5M or involving long-term debt/bonds).

FCA votes to:

- Approve/reject major civic builds (buildings, large park projects, major road expansions).
- Choose between alternative designs (Option A/B/C) when staff present multiple viable options.

### B. Major PPPs and Large Land Deals

**Trigger:** any PPP or development that:

- Uses FCIIA/city land **or**
- Receives incentives above a threshold (TIF, CID, abatements, revenue sharing) **or**
- Exceeds specified size (acres, square footage, or jobs).

FCA votes to approve/reject:

- Large data-center and industrial campuses.
- Major mixed-use/housing projects on strategic public land.
- Subsequent phases/expansions under predefined conditions.

### C. Community Benefit & Participatory Budgeting Pools

**Trigger:** dedicated funds such as:

- A fixed % of new ground rents or FCIIA project surpluses.
- Portions of TIF/CID/TDD surpluses.
- Defined slices of new growth in the general fund (if adopted).

FCA allocates:

- **City-wide pot:** cross-city investments (large parks, trails, safety projects).
- **Neighborhood pots:** ward-level improvements (sidewalks, traffic calming, pocket parks, etc.).

### D. Loosening Key Protections (Guardrails)

**Trigger:** any proposal to **weaken** key city-wide protections, such as:

- Noise standards for large industrial/digital uses.
- Water-use and well/river protection rules.
- Greenspace/tree canopy minimums in designated zones.
- Heavy-truck/traffic caps on particular corridors.

FCA must consent to loosening these rules; Council may only override via supermajority (e.g., 2/3) plus written findings.

### E. Long-Term Plans and “North Star” Frameworks

For comprehensive plans, long-range transportation plans, economic strategies, and resilience/energy principles:

- FCA selects a preferred scenario or plan.
- Council and FCIIA must **align** or publicly **explain any divergence** (“comply or explain”).

---

## 4. Roles: Mayor/Council, FCIIA, FCA

- **Mayor & Council**
  - Continue to pass ordinances, budgets, zoning, and policies.
  - Negotiate deals and represent voters.
- **FCIIA**
  - Holds/leases land, enforces covenants, and manages project-level finances.
  - Implements decisions within the framework set by ordinances and FCA outcomes.
- **FCA (citizen layer)**
  - Provides binding or strongly binding decisions on **defined categories**.
  - Makes final calls on selected big projects and spending pools, subject to legal limits.

In practice, big levers are pre-committed to public votes, and elected officials operate inside that frame.

---

## 5. Phased Rollout

**Phase 0 – Legal Shell**

- Amend the FDIA/FCIC concept into **FCIIA** with city-wide remit in charter/bylaws.
- Keep the data-center/OZ campus as the first program.

**Phase 1 – Pilot City-Wide Powers**

- Introduce one modest participatory budget pool under FCA control.
- Require an FCA vote for major capital projects above a threshold.
- Use FCA for advisory votes on comprehensive-plan / long-range-plan priorities.

**Phase 2 – Expand Portfolio**

- Move new PPPs and strategic parcels under FCIIA.
- Standardize: “no major PPP without FCA sign-off via FCIIA.”

**Phase 3 – Deep Integration**

- Consider charter changes making FCIIA and FCA permanent fixtures.
- Optionally tie a defined slice of general-fund growth to FCA-controlled participatory budgeting.

## 6. Resident’s-Eye View

For a typical Festus resident, the goal is that this feels simple:

- “We have a **Civic Authority** that manages big land and projects for the city.”
- “We have a **Civic Assembly app** where we vote directly on:
  - big builds,
  - chunks of the budget,
  - and whether large private projects expand or not.”
- “Council and Mayor can’t quietly push through major deals; if they override a citizen vote, it takes a supermajority and a written explanation.”

This document is a **conceptual roadmap**, not a legal instrument. Any real implementation would require detailed legal drafting, public process, and formal adoption by Festus.
