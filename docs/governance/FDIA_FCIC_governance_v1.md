# FDIA/FCIC Governance Model v1

**TL;DR (Plain English)**
- A community-controlled FDIA/FCIC board holds the land, covenants, and key contracts.
- Big decisions about land, covenants, and community revenue need a supermajority vote plus citizen representation.
- City Council keeps control of zoning and major fiscal tools, while FDIA/FCIC manages the platform and operator relationship.

> Note: This governance model is a draft for discussion and must be refined with local legal counsel and aligned with Festus ordinances.

This document outlines a first-pass governance model for the Festus Digital Infrastructure Authority / Festus Community Infrastructure Corporation (FDIA/FCIC) overseeing the community-controlled digital infrastructure platform.

## 1. Purpose of the Entity

- Hold and control the project land, long-term ground lease, and key covenants.
- Contract with private operators under long-term leases/concessions.
- Protect community interests around noise, water, environmental impact, and growth.
- Manage and transparently distribute community revenue streams.

## 2. Board Composition

Recommended 7-member board:
- 2x City-appointed seats (e.g., council or mayoral appointments).
- 1x Local institution seat (e.g., school district, college, or major civic institution).
- 2x Citizen representative seats (selected via transparent application + council confirmation or similar).
- 1x Technical/infra expert seat (nominated jointly by city and board, confirmed by supermajority).
- 1x At-large community/economic development seat.

### Terms
- Standard 3-year terms, staggered so that no more than 1/3 of seats turn over in any given year.
- Term limits (e.g., max 2 consecutive terms) to prevent capture.

### Basic Eligibility
- Residency or strong local ties for most seats, with an explicit carve-out for the technical expert.
- Clear conflict-of-interest rules (e.g., no direct financial interest in selected operator without recusal/minimum cooling-off period).

### For other communities (tunable parameters)
- Board size and exact seat mix (city, institutions, citizens, experts).
- Eligibility rules and conflict-of-interest standards.
- Term lengths, staggering, and term limits.
- Whether citizen seats are elected, appointed, or selected via application.

## 3. Voting and Decision Rules

### Simple Majority (>= 4 of 7)
Used for routine matters:
- Annual budget and operating plan.
- Approving standard reports and audits.
- Entering into non-material service contracts.

### Supermajority (>= 5 of 7)
Used for decisions that can materially change community risk or control:
- Sale or encumbrance of land.
- Major amendments to noise, water, traffic, or environmental covenants.
- Approving any expansion that increases power draw or physical footprint beyond pre-agreed thresholds.
- Changing the formula for community revenue allocation.
- Replacing the technical/infra expert before term end.

### Quorum
- Quorum at 4 of 7 members.
- Supermajority thresholds always counted against full board size, not just members present.

## 4. Reserved Matters and Vetoes

Certain decisions should require both a supermajority and explicit citizen representation support:
- For the items above requiring supermajority, require at least 1 citizen representative to vote "yes" for the motion to pass.
- Optionally, define a narrow set of decisions where *both* citizen reps must support the decision (e.g., sale of land, permanent relaxation of noise or environmental covenants).

## 5. Relationship to City Council

- The city retains control over zoning, permits, and any direct fiscal commitments (TIF, CID, tax abatements).
- FDIA/FCIC operates the platform (land + ground lease + covenants) but reports regularly to council.
- At minimum, require:
  - Annual public report and council presentation.
  - Publication of audited financial statements.
  - Public posting of key contracts and covenants (with appropriate redactions where legally necessary).

## 6. Committees (Optional but Recommended)

- **Audit & Finance Committee**
  - Oversees budgets, audits, and compliance with financial covenants.
- **Community & Environment Committee**
  - Monitors noise, water, environmental performance, and community benefits.
- **Technical & Infrastructure Committee**
  - Reviews operator performance, reliability, and capacity planning.

Each committee should include at least one citizen representative and report back to the full board on a regular schedule.

## 7. Transparency and Community Input

- All regular board meetings should be open to the public, with agendas posted in advance.
- Key documents (charter, bylaws, covenants, annual reports) should be easily accessible online.
- Provide structured mechanisms for community input (e.g., comment periods, quarterly town halls).

## 8. Next Steps

- Convert this outline into a formal charter/bylaws document with counsel.
- Align specific seat appointment processes with Missouri law and Festus ordinances.
- Ensure consistency with the eventual capital stack and operator RFP requirements.



## 9. City-wide evolution (optional)

For communities that want to extend this model beyond a single data-center or campus project, see `docs/governance/festus_citywide_civic_authority_and_assembly_v1.md` for an example of a city-wide Festus Civic Infrastructure & Innovation Authority (FCIIA) and Festus Civic Assembly (FCA).

That concept note shows how a project-specific authority like FDIA/FCIC can evolve into a broader civic authority and resident assembly that manage multiple PPPs, participatory budgeting pools, and long-term planning decisions.
