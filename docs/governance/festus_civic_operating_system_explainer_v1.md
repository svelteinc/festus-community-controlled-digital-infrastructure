# Festus Civic Authority & Assembly – New Civic Operating System (Draft v1)

> **Plain-language explainer.** This is a draft concept for discussion, not a legal document or a final decision.

---

## 1. Why change how Festus makes big decisions?

Festus is being asked to consider projects (like data centers and other large developments) that are big, long-lived, and sometimes controversial.

Right now, many residents feel that:

- Big deals can move **too fast** and **out of sight**.
- People often find out when the decision is almost made.
- Benefits and burdens do not always feel fairly shared.

The idea here is **not** to remove the Mayor or Council. It is to add two tools that make major decisions **more transparent and more shared**:

1. A **Civic Authority** that manages public land and big partnerships.
2. A **Civic Assembly** where residents vote directly on the biggest choices.

---

## 2. The three main pieces

### A. Festus Civic Infrastructure & Innovation Authority (FCIIA)

- A city-created public entity.
- Holds and ground-leases **strategic public land** (industrial areas, OZ sites, campuses, etc.).
- Manages **major public–private partnerships (PPPs)**.
- Receives and distributes project-related revenues (ground rent, community-benefit payments, selected surpluses).

Think of FCIIA as the **long-term landlord and steward** for big projects.

### B. Festus Civic Assembly (FCA)

- A **one-person-one-vote** platform for Festus residents.
- Used when a decision crosses a clear threshold (size, cost, risk).
- On defined topics, its decisions are **binding** on FCIIA and strongly binding on Council (with a high-bar override and written explanation).

Think of FCA as a **standing city-wide ballot** for the big stuff.

### C. Mayor & Council

- Still write ordinances and budgets.
- Still negotiate deals and represent voters.
- Agree up front that for the **highest-impact decisions**, they will follow FCA outcomes or publicly explain any departure.

---

## 3. Where citizens get a direct, binding say

Examples of categories that can be routed through FCA:

1. **Major capital projects** above a set size
   - New civic buildings, major park projects, big road expansions.
   - Residents vote to approve/reject or select among options (A/B/C design).

2. **Large PPPs and land deals**
   - Data center campuses, industrial/logistics parks, big mixed-use or housing projects on public/strategic land.
   - Residents vote on the key term sheet and on later expansion phases.

3. **Community benefit and participatory budget pools**
   - A defined share of new ground rent, surpluses, or community-benefit funds set aside each year.
   - Residents decide how to spend:
     - A city-wide pot (large cross-city investments).
     - Ward-level pots (sidewalks, traffic calming, pocket parks, etc.).

4. **Loosening key protections**
   - Noise caps, water protections, tree/greenspace minimums, truck caps on certain corridors.
   - FCA must consent before rules are weakened; Council may only override with a supermajority and written findings.

## 4. Example: a Phase 2 expansion on a campus

1. FCIIA and a private partner negotiate a draft expansion: size, layout, buffers, jobs, and revenues.
2. Independent assessments on noise, water, traffic, and fiscal impacts are shared publicly.
3. Residents see a plain-language FCA question like:
   - "Approve Phase 2 as proposed"
   - "Approve with stricter noise/water limits (Option B)"
   - "Do not approve Phase 2 at this time"
4. Residents vote through the Civic Assembly (with in-person/assisted options as needed).
5. FCIIA acts in line with the FCA decision; Council agrees not to approve conflicting actions except under clear, pre-defined override rules.

---

## 5. How this relates to FDIA/FCIC and the data center

- The original FDIA/FCIC model was **project-specific** for a data-center campus.
- FCIIA/FCA is a **city-wide evolution** of that idea.
- The data-center campus simply becomes **Program 1** under FCIIA, sitting alongside other major projects over time.

For details, see:

- `docs/governance/FDIA_FCIC_governance_v1.md` – project-level authority.
- `docs/governance/festus_citywide_civic_authority_and_assembly_v1.md` – deeper city-wide concept note.

---

## 6. What this is and is not

- This is a **conceptual explainer**, not a legal, tax, or investment document.
- It does **not** commit Festus to create FCIIA or FCA, or to adopt any particular thresholds.
- It also does **not** assume that the person sharing this explainer will sit on or work for any future entity.

Any real implementation would need:

- Formal charter/bylaws drafted with local counsel.
- Ordinances defining the scope of FCA votes and Council’s override rules.
- Technical work to implement a secure, accessible voting and identity system.
