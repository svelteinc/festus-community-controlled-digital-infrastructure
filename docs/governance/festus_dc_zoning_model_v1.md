# Festus Data Center & Edge Compute Zoning Model (Draft v1)

> **Draft for discussion.** This is a non-binding concept note to help local counsel and planners. It is not legal advice and does not reflect current Festus code.

---

## 1. Purpose

Provide a practical zoning framework that:

- **Blocks hyperscale data centers** in city limits for now.
- **Allows small, “good neighbor” modular data centers** under tight standards.
- **Permits edge / telco-style sites** as utilities, not as mega-campuses.
- **Encourages regional/utility data centers** outside sensitive areas.
- Ties larger compute uses to **Festus Civic Assembly (FCA)** approval when they cross defined thresholds.

All section numbers/district names below are placeholders. Local counsel must map them to actual Festus zoning districts and ordinance format.

## 2. Key definitions (conceptual)

Example working definitions:

- **Data Center (general)** – A facility used primarily for housing computer servers, data storage equipment, and associated infrastructure.
- **Hyperscale Data Center** – A data center (or contiguous group of buildings under common control) with any of the following:
  - Connected load above **X MW** (e.g., 20–30 MW), or
  - Building area above **Y square feet**, or
  - More than **Z** full-size equipment halls.
- **Micro / Modular Data Center** – A data center with:
  - Connected load between **1 and 5 MW** (tunable), and
  - Building/compound size within a defined light-industrial envelope.
- **Edge / Telco Site** – A small facility (often containerized) with:
  - Connected load below **1 MW**, and
  - Floor area below a defined threshold, used for caching, telco, or local control.
- **Regional / Utility Data Center** – A larger campus outside Festus city limits, sited by a multi-jurisdictional entity (county/utility/FCIIA-style JV) near a major substation or transmission node.

Numbers (X, Y, Z) are policy choices and should be set via separate technical work.

## 3. Use permissions by district (high level)

**Hyperscale Data Centers**

- Prohibited in all city zoning districts for now (explicit statement).
- Optional clause: Council may revisit this only with:
  - FCA approval via city-wide vote, and
  - Supermajority Council vote with written findings.

**Micro / Modular Data Centers (1–5 MW)**

- Allowed as a **conditional use** only in:
  - Light Industrial districts (e.g., LI/M-1).
  - General Industrial districts (e.g., GI/M-2).
- Prohibited in:
  - Residential districts.
  - Neighborhood-scale commercial districts.
  - Sensitive environmental zones (floodplain, critical habitat) unless special findings.

**Edge / Telco Sites (<1 MW)**

- Allowed as a **permitted or conditional accessory use** in:
  - Utility, transportation, and industrial districts.
  - At substations, along appropriate corridors, or on large industrial parcels.
- Subject to screening, noise, and design standards (see below).

## 4. Capacity caps and FCA triggers

The goal is to bake in simple, quantitative guardrails.

Example policy:

1. **City-wide caps**
   - Total connected data center load in city limits (all sites combined) shall not exceed **C MW** without an FCA vote.
   - No single site (micro or edge aggregation) shall exceed **S MW** without an FCA vote.

2. **FCA trigger language (concept)**
   - Any application that would:
     - Push total city-wide load above **C MW**, or
     - Create a site above **S MW**, or
     - Expand an existing site above those thresholds,
   - must be conditioned on:
     - A binding FCA vote approving the project or expansion, and
     - A supermajority FCIIA board approval (if FCIIA land is involved).

Thresholds C and S are policy choices; this document only sketches the structure.

## 5. Performance and “good neighbor” standards

For micro and edge sites, require:

- **Noise limits** – Measured at property lines and at nearest residences, with stricter limits at night; generator testing limited to specified daytime hours.
- **Water use and cooling** – Preference for air-cooled or low-water designs; any water-cooled systems require usage caps, monitoring, and drought/peak-draw protocols.
- **Setbacks and screening** – Minimum setbacks from residential zones; opaque fencing, landscaping, and visual screening of equipment.
- **Lighting** – Full cut-off fixtures, no up-lighting, curfew for non-essential lighting.
- **Traffic and access** – Limits on heavy-truck trips; defined loading/unloading hours; circulation designed to avoid residential streets where possible.
- **Resilience and safety** – Clear standards for fuel storage, fire suppression, and emergency shutdown; coordination with local fire/EMS.

These standards should be written as objective criteria so Planning & Zoning can apply them consistently.

---

## 6. Regional / utility data centers and policy direction

Festus can adopt an explicit **policy preference** that:

- Large AI training and other high-intensity compute should primarily be served by **regional or utility-scale data centers** outside sensitive areas.
- The city will consider participation as:
  - Minor equity partner or landlord in a regional campus.
  - Power off-taker under defined conditions.
  - Revenue-sharing partner through FCIIA or similar entities.

Zoning language can note that hyperscale proposals are expected to be directed to such regional solutions rather than sited inside Festus.

---

## 7. Implementation notes

- This document is a **policy-oriented model**, not a ready-to-file ordinance.
- Local legal counsel and planning staff must:
  - Map concepts to actual Festus zoning districts and code sections.
  - Confirm consistency with Missouri law and existing comprehensive plans.
  - Refine thresholds (MW, size) and insert cross-references to FCA/FCIIA where appropriate.

The intent is to give Festus a clear, practical alternative: **connectivity and economic upside without uncontrolled hyperscale build-out inside city limits.**
