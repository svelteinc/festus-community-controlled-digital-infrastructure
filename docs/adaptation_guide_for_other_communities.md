# Adapting the Festus CCDI Playbook for Other Communities (Draft v1)

This guide explains how other cities, towns, and regions can adapt the Festus Community-Controlled Digital Infrastructure (CCDI) playbook.

It is **not legal, tax, or investment advice**. Any real project must be designed and implemented with qualified local legal and financial advisors.

---

## 1. Rename and Re-scope

1. Replace "Festus" with your own community name across documentation.
2. Replace FDIA/FCIC with your own public entity or authority name (e.g., "Springfield Digital Infrastructure Authority").
3. Confirm that your jurisdiction allows a similar public entity structure (authority, corporation, district, etc.).

## 2. Governance Parameters to Tune

Use `docs/governance/FDIA_FCIC_governance_v1.md` as a template, but adjust:

- **Board size and composition**
  - Number of seats.
  - Mix of city appointees, institutions, citizens, and experts.
- **Term lengths and limits**
  - Length of terms (e.g., 3 or 4 years).
  - Maximum consecutive terms.
- **Reserved matters and vetoes**
  - Which decisions require supermajority vs. simple majority.
  - When citizen representatives must support a decision.
- **Committee structure**
  - Audit/finance, community/environment, technical/infra committees.
  - Required citizen representation on each committee.

All governance choices should be checked against local law and charter/ordinance requirements.

## 3. Capital Stack Parameters to Tune

Use `docs/capital_stack/phase1_capital_stack_v1.md` as a conceptual template, but adapt:

- **Project scale**
  - Order-of-magnitude cost and size.
- **Debt vs. equity mix**
  - Target leverage (e.g., 50–65% senior debt, 35–50% equity) based on lender appetite.
- **Ground rent and fee formulas**
  - Fixed ground rent per MW or per facility.
  - Variable fee structure (e.g., per-MW or revenue-based).
- **Community bond options**
  - Whether local law permits revenue bonds or similar instruments.
  - Who may buy them (residents, institutions, broader investors).

All financial structures must be vetted with local legal and financial advisors and aligned with applicable securities laws.

---

## 4. Community Engagement and Narrative

Adapt `docs/community_engagement/` and `docs/vision/` to local context:

- Tailor examples and language to local concerns (noise, water, traffic, jobs).
- Identify local groups and channels (Facebook groups, neighborhood associations, local press).
- Translate key materials if your community uses multiple languages.

The goal is to **share early, listen carefully, and revise** before any binding decisions.

---

## 5. Legal and Financial Review

Before moving beyond discussion:

1. Engage local counsel to convert the governance outline into a formal charter/bylaws.
2. Work with financial advisors to draft term sheets and bond documents consistent with local rules.
3. Stress-test the capital stack and covenant structure for downside scenarios.
