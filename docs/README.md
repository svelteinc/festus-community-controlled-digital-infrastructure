# Festus CCDI Documentation

This directory contains the conceptual, legal, financial, and community-facing documentation for the Festus Community-Controlled Digital Infrastructure (CCDI) program.

## Subdirectories

- `vision/` – goals, principles, and high-level narrative.
- `governance/` – FDIA/FCIC structure, board seats, bylaws, and decision rules.
- `capital_stack/` – financing models, term sheets, and risk analyses.
- `rfp/` – RFP drafts, evaluation criteria, and operator covenant templates.
- `community_engagement/` – public-facing materials, FAQs, and feedback logs.
- `tokenization/` – Phase 2+ tokenized community bond/RWA designs.

Each subdirectory should contain focused markdown documents instead of large monolithic files.

## How to Adapt for Other Communities

This documentation is written for Festus, but other cities can reuse it by:
- Replacing “Festus” and FDIA/FCIC with your local authority names.
- Adjusting governance details to match your legal and political context.
- Updating financial assumptions and covenants to reflect local realities.
