# Phase 1 Capital Stack – Festus CCDI (Draft v1)

**TL;DR (Plain English)**
- A private operator pays to build and run the facility.
- The city, through FDIA/FCIC, keeps control of the land and key rules.
- The community receives predictable revenue (ground rent + small usage fees).
- The project, not the city's general budget, is designed to bear the financial risk.

> **Important:** This is a conceptual example for discussion only and is not legal, tax, or investment advice. Any actual financing must be reviewed and implemented with qualified legal and financial advisors.

This document outlines a conservative, financeable Phase 1 capital stack for the Festus Community-Controlled Digital Infrastructure (CCDI) project.

## 1. Objectives

- Keep instruments **boring and legible** to traditional lenders and local stakeholders.
- Use the FDIA/FCIC as the **platform owner** (land + covenants + ground lease).
- Allow a private operator to fund, build, and operate the facility.
- Provide **clear, predictable revenue** to the community via ground rent and fees.
- Leave room for a **Phase 2 tokenized layer** without changing the underlying economics.

## 2. Capital Stack Overview (Conceptual)

For an initial development phase (e.g., a first facility in the $X0–$X00M range):

- **City / FDIA/FCIC contribution**
  - Land contributed or controlled by the city and leased to FDIA/FCIC.
  - FDIA/FCIC grants a long-term **ground lease** to the private operator.

- **Senior Debt (Conventional)**
  - Commercial bank or infrastructure lender.
  - Secured primarily by:
    - Leasehold interest of the operator.
    - Project cash flows (offtake/hosting contracts, etc.).
  - Target: ~50–65% of total project cost (to be refined with actual numbers).

- **Private Equity (Operator / Sponsors)**
  - Operator and/or sponsors fund the remaining project costs (35–50%).
  - Equity returns driven by operating cash flow after debt service and fees.

- **Community Revenue Streams**
  - **Ground rent**: fixed or indexed per-MW annual rent paid to FDIA/FCIC.
  - **Per-MW or revenue-based fee**: small variable component to align upside.
  - These revenues can later support:
    - Plain-vanilla community bonds.
    - Tokenized mirrors of those bonds in Phase 2.

### For other communities (parameters to tune)
- Project size and cost range.
- Target senior debt percentage and equity percentage.
- Ground rent level (per-MW or per-facility) and indexation.
- Structure and size of any variable usage-based fees.
- Whether and when to add community bonds.

## 3. City / FDIA/FCIC Contribution (Platform Layer)

- The city either:
  - Contributes land into FDIA/FCIC, or
  - Grants FDIA/FCIC a long-term control interest (e.g., 99-year ground lease).

- FDIA/FCIC responsibilities:
  - Hold and enforce covenants (noise, water, environmental, expansion caps).
  - Enter into and monitor the ground lease with operator.
  - Receive and transparently allocate community revenues.

This structure keeps the **platform** (land + rules) under community control while letting private capital fund the facility.

## 4. Senior Debt – Key Terms (Illustrative)

- **Type**: Project finance or corporate debt secured by leasehold interest.
- **Tenor**: 7–15 years depending on lender appetite and asset profile.
- **Security**:
  - First lien on project assets, leases, and key cash flows.
  - Assignment of major contracts (subject to FDIA/FCIC consent).
- **Covenants** (non-exhaustive):
  - Minimum debt service coverage ratio (DSCR).
  - Restrictions on additional indebtedness at the project vehicle.
  - Information and reporting requirements.

FDIA/FCIC should **not** guarantee the debt; the project and equity should bear performance risk.

## 5. Private Equity – Operator / Sponsors

- Equity funds:
  - Construction costs (beyond debt proceeds).
  - Pre-development and permitting.
  - Initial working capital.

- Return profile:
  - Target IRR negotiated between city/FDIA/FCIC and private partners.
  - Protected by:
    - Reasonable and stable covenants.
    - Clarity about tax, zoning, and infrastructure commitments.

The capital stack should be framed so that **commercial returns are achievable** without compromising community protections.

## 6. Community Bonds (Plain Vanilla Option)

Once the project has a clear revenue profile (e.g., ground rent + per-MW fees):

- FDIA/FCIC may **issue simple revenue bonds** backed by a portion of its cash flows.
- These bonds can be offered to:
  - Local residents.
  - Regional investors.
  - Mission-aligned institutions.

Design principles:
- Conventional legal form (e.g., revenue bonds or notes) first.
- Transparent risk disclosures.
- Conservative leverage (do not over-pledge revenues).

In Phase 2, these same bonds can be **mirrored or represented on-chain** for broader access.

## 7. Alignment with Governance and Covenants

The capital stack must be **consistent** with FDIA/FCIC governance:
- Supermajority + citizen support for changes that materially affect:
  - Land ownership.
  - Covariance and environmental protections.
  - Revenue allocation formulas.
- Lender rights must be drafted so they do **not** override core community controls.

## 8. Next Steps

- Insert **order-of-magnitude cost estimates** for Phase 1 to refine percentages.
- Work with counsel and financial advisors to:
  - Draft term sheets for senior lenders and equity partners.
  - Define exact bond structures (if any) that match Missouri rules.
- Ensure capital documents and RFP language are aligned with this stack.
