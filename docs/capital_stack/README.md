# Capital Stack Documentation

This directory captures financing structures and instruments for the Festus CCDI development.

Typical documents:
- Baseline capital stack diagrams (city contribution, debt, private equity).
- Draft term sheets for lenders and private partners.
- Community bond concepts (plain vanilla first; tokenized later).
- Risk, covenant, and scenario analyses.
