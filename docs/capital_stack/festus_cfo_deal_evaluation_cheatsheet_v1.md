# Festus CCDI – CFO / Finance Director Deal Evaluation Cheat-Sheet (Draft v1)

> For City Managers, finance directors, and external advisors reviewing digital infrastructure or related deals. Not legal, tax, or investment advice.

This sheet is meant to sit next to `docs/capital_stack/phase1_capital_stack_v1.md` and the corridor strategy documents.

## 1. Big picture questions

Before looking at numbers, ask:

1. **Does this project fit the Festus Area Corridor strategy?**
   - Advanced/specialty manufacturing, health care, main-street services, or carefully sized digital infrastructure.
   - Or is it a noisy, water-intensive, thin-job, speculative, or one-off resort play?
2. **Is it designed to live under FDIA/FCIC + FCIIA/FCA guardrails?**
   - Land held by a public-purpose entity with covenants.
   - Major changes and expansions linked to resident-facing processes.
3. **What happens if it goes sideways?**
   - Who holds the risk (city general fund vs. project-level entity vs. private partners)?
   - Can the site be repurposed for a better use later?

---

## 2. Core financial checks (Phase 1-style projects)

Use `phase1_capital_stack_v1.md` as your baseline and compare:

- **Project scale vs. city capacity**
  - Total capital cost vs. annual city budget.
  - Size relative to power, water, and road capacity.
- **Leverage and DSCR**
  - Target leverage (e.g., 50–65% senior debt) vs. what lenders require.
  - Modeled DSCR under base, downside, and severe downside scenarios.
- **Revenue to the community**
  - Ground rent: predictable, inflation-linked?
  - Usage-based fees: conservative assumptions? tied to MW or revenue?
  - Any participation in upside (within reason)?
- **Exposure of the general fund**
  - Are there any direct or implied guarantees by the city?
  - Are infrastructure commitments appropriately phased and cost-shared?

If you cannot obtain clear answers to these points, treat that as a **red flag**.

## 3. Guardrail alignment checklist

For each proposed deal, check:

- **Land & governance**
  - Is the land held by FDIA/FCIC (or equivalent) with covenants matching the zoning and ordinance intent?
  - Are key decisions designated as **reserved matters** with appropriate supermajority and citizen representation?
- **Noise, water, traffic, and environment**
  - Does the proposal meet or beat the city’s performance standards?
  - Are there clear monitoring and enforcement mechanisms?
- **Transparency and reporting**
  - Are the main commercial terms and public benefits explainable on a one-page summary?
  - Are reporting obligations clear and enforceable?

If a project asks for exceptions to any of these, insist on **stronger financial and community upside** or treat it as misaligned.

## 4. Comparing proposals

When you have multiple options (e.g., different operators, or digital vs non-digital uses for a site):

1. **Normalize the horizon**
   - Compare net fiscal impact, jobs, and risks over the same 10–20 year period.
2. **Score against a simple grid**
   - Fiscal: net revenues, volatility, exposure to general fund.
   - Jobs: quantity, quality, training pathways, local hiring.
   - Externalities: noise, water, traffic, visual impact, climate resilience.
   - Option value: ability to pivot the site if conditions change.
3. **Show residents the trade-offs**
   - Use `festus_dc_options_onepager_v1.md` and corridor materials to explain choices simply.

## 5. Bitcoin and mining-specific notes

If a proposal involves bitcoin or other proof-of-work mining:

- Revisit `bitcoin_background_v1.md` and `bitcoin_resident_summary_v1.md`.
- Pay special attention to:
  - Noise and 24/7 operations.
  - Power draw vs. local grid constraints.
  - Limited job creation vs. tax/fee revenues.
- Insist on:
  - Shorter terms and more frequent review.
  - Stronger flexibility to repurpose the site if economics or politics change.

---

## 6. Process and documentation

For any major deal:

- Keep a **deal memo** that: 
  - Summarizes financial structure and guardrail alignment.
  - Records key risks, mitigations, and alternative options considered.
- Ensure Council and, where applicable, the **Festus Civic Assembly** receive:
  - A clear written summary.
  - Enough time and support to understand trade-offs.
- Use lessons from each deal to **update the capital stack docs and models** over time.
