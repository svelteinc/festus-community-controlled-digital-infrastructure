# Deploy

This directory will hold deployment and infrastructure-as-code assets (for example, Terraform, CloudFormation, or scripted deploy recipes) for running CCDI-related services.

Right now it is a placeholder so downstream cities and contributors know where to add deployment configs as the project matures.
