# Source Code

All application, modeling, and simulation code for the Festus CCDI project lives under `src/`.

Planned subpackages:
- `common/` – shared utilities (config loading, logging, data models).
- `agents/` – simulation/decision agents (city, operator, community, lenders).
- `data_pipeline/` – ingestion and transformation of external data.
- `orchestrator/` – coordination of workflows and scenario runs.
- `simulator/` – simulation engines and analytical models.
